## Acknowledgement

Thanks and sorry for those who contribute to the code base of this website.

I set this website up when I was just a newbie and adopted the codebase I cannot find the original source now.

Based on what I can remember, by large possibility, I initialed this website according to [Jekyllrb Documents](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
