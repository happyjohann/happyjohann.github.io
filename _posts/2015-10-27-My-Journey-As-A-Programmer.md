This time, I should try to be more concentrated.

## This and That
It has been quite a long period of time since i wrote my first hello world in C as as candidate senior high school student in the summer of 2008. However, I cannot anounce myself as a professional programming although I have been coding from time to time during these more than 7 years.  

As a student, I have learned many programming languages and stuff around, from C algorithm programming to matlab mathmatical programming, from iOS apps development to web sites development, and of course related areas such as Regular Expressions, JSON, XML, Markdown, Apache and so on. However, not an expert in any of these fileds.

## The Journey of Programming
The first language I learned is C. For three years in my pre-senior and senior high school, I spent a large part of my scarcy time in learning C algorithm programming aiming at the NOIP first prize. However, I was just not the lucky one. With the *index from 0* or *index from 1* mistake, I missed the first prize. During this three years, in fact, I didn't learn many about programming language, but not less about data structure and algorithm. By the way, I enjoyed the concentrating experience and it seems from that time on, concepts such as pointer, array, recursion and search are for sure to me. This experience did give me an advantage among my fellows.  

With 3 years' advantage in programming, I easily became one menmber of the best CS students groups in my university, that is, [Dian Group](http://dian.hust.edu.cn/) and [Bingyan Studio](http://www.bingyan.net/). During two years there, I experienced a few projets, learned a lot of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, XQuery, XPath, Regular Expression, Objective-C, XML, JSON and so on. 

And as a *Informatick* student, as courses, I learnt or relearnt VB.net, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, Java, Python, Matlab.  

From student group projects to course projects, I have experienced quite many projects, including Website, iOS app, Android app, Winform app and even Data Mining projects.

## The However
However, I have no confidence to say, I can make a good app by myself alone or have a really good knowledge of any of these field.

So I decide to take some time to reorganize my old codes, possibly, push to my github repositories and use this blog to record what I learn and experience during the new start of programming journey.
